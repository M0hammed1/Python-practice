# Python Practice

## Overview
This repository is part of a Python practice series, focusing on creating practical applications with Python. The initial project is an EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) Calculator which helps in calculating the monthly payments for loans based on certain inputs like principal, interest rate, and tenure.

## Contents
- **EMI Calculator.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that contains the Python code to calculate the EMI for different loans. It includes functions to compute the EMI given loan details and also explores different scenarios by varying the parameters.

## How to Use
To use the EMI calculator:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, you can install them via Anaconda or directly from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/).
3. Navigate to the directory containing the notebook and run `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` from your command line.
4. Open the `EMI Calculator.ipynb` file in Jupyter and run the cells to see how the EMI is calculated.

## Future Enhancements
Future versions of this project may include:
- A web-based interface for the EMI calculator.
- Additional financial functions to complement the EMI calculator, such as savings plan estimators or investment return calculators.
- Enhanced visualization of payment schedules and interest components.
